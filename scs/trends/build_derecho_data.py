---------------------
One record per derecho in the SPC archive of Squitieri, Wade and Jirak (2026),
carrying the NOAA/NCEI Storm Events thunderstorm-wind reports that fall inside
the archive's own event window.

Why this replaces the previous version
--------------------------------------
The first version of this script worked from Shourd and Kaplan (2025), which
publishes DATES only.  A date is not an event -- 10 Aug 2020 has severe wind in
21 states -- so that version invented a rule (single-link reports within 150 km
and 3 h, keep the largest group) to guess which reports belonged to the storm.
It worked, but it was my heuristic standing in for a definition.

The SPC archive publishes, for every one of its 184 wind swaths, the UTC time
and position of the first and last report.  So the guessing is gone.  Reports
are selected by the paper's own two rules:

  1. UTC time falls within [start, end] of the swath.
  2. Spatial progress matches temporal progress.  The paper defines, for a report
     at distance dx from the start point and time tx after it,

         SP = (dx - di) / D        TP = (tx - ti) / T

     with D the swath length and T its duration, and requires |SP - TP| below
     0.5 for short (~400 km) swaths tightening to 0.25 above 1000 km.  A report
     700 km downstream four minutes into a thirteen-hour event is a different
     storm, and this is what says so.
  3. The report lies within (track length + 100 km) of BOTH endpoints.
  4. It joins the coherent swath.  The paper builds its wind-swath polygon by
     growing disks of at least 25 km around each report "until all circles
     overlapped"; here the radius grows from 25 km in 5 km steps until the
     largest connected group holds 90% of the reports, capped at 75 km, and only
     that group is the swath.  Reports left outside are kept and drawn grey.

The published envelope is that UNION OF DISKS, not a convex hull.  This matters:
a hull spans empty space to reach any outlier, so two stray reports in northern
Wisconsin and northeast Michigan were stretching the 10 Aug 2020 envelope up
over Lake Michigan.  The union hugs the reports and simply does not go there.

Everything drawn is therefore either the archive's or a direct consequence of
its published window.  The track line is the archive's start and end points; it
exists for every event, including the pre-NEXRAD ones, so a storm from 1956 is
still drawable when the report record behind it is thin.

Report coverage by era (thunderstorm wind, checked against the source CSV)

    1955-1992   100.0% carry coordinates
    1993-1995     0.0%  -- placed at their county centroid instead
    1996-2024    99.5%
    2025          absent from this extract entirely

Seven events therefore come up with no reports, and neither cause is a fault in
the archive:

  * 2025-04-29, 2025-06-20, 2025-07-29 -- the report file stops at 2024.
  * 1993-06-04, 1993-06-09, 1993-06-29, 1993-07-08 -- June and July 1993 are
    MISSING OUTRIGHT from wind_events_complete_years.csv (and from the tornado
    file).  Not sparse, not uncoordinated: zero rows.  Worth knowing beyond this
    script, because those are peak severe-weather months and any climatology
    that treats 1993 as a real zero will read it as a quiet year rather than an
    absent one.
